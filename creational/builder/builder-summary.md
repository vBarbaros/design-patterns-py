# Main idea
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation 
so that the same construction process can create different representations.


# Also known as
N/A

# Why we need it
When a specific functionality is provided by a considerably complex class
you would prefer to have a template of such a class so that for variations
of the aforementioned functionality it is easy add new classes of similar
complexity.
